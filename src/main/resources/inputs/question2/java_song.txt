Java oh Java the language of choice
For many a programmer with a steady and strong voice
A versatile language with libraries galore
It's no wonder it's a favorite and sought after more and more

Programmers the masters of code
They pour their hearts and minds into every single node
They craft and create with logic and skill
Their hard work and dedication a never-ending thrill

Interviews a daunting task
For programmers seeking a job a necessary ask
But with Java in their arsenal and their skills on display
They tackle the questions and ace the interview all the way

So here's to Java and to the programmers who know it well
May their interviews go smoothly and their careers truly excel
